<P>God of War Ragnarok confirmed its Scandinavian mythology-inspired appendage during the grand finale of PlayStation's September showcase last year. In doing so, developer Sony Santa Monica Studio gave us a bumper trailer that included familiar faces, friends and foes, an older Kratos and a more mature and almost unrecognisable Atreus - alongside a slew of game details and ambiguous plot points ripe for dissecting and discussing. </P>
<P>Which is, of course, the point of this page - read on for everything we know about God of War Ragnarok, including all the news and information we have so far, the rumours, our best guesses and that big old trailer. </P>
<P>Sony Santa Monica and PlayStation Studios recently announced that God of War Ragnarok has been delayed to 2022. As mentioned earlier, this wasn't a huge surprise. The fact that we haven't seen any gameplay, cinematics, story details, or even a proper trailer halfway into 2021 meant a delay was inevitable.</P>
<P>The new God of War Ragnarok trailer gave us a good idea of what to expect from the story. Years have passed since the end of 2018's God of War, evidenced by an older, more confident Atreus whose giant genes are starting to show. </P>
<P>Together father and son must face the impending Ragnarok - the legendary Norse version of an apocalypse - facing the enemies they made in God of War like Freya, new ones like Thor, and all as Kratos wrestles with his son's rebellious streak and his knowledge of who Atreus really is. The story will take place across the Nine Realms - you only saw six in God of War - adding Vanaheim, Svartalfheim, and Asgard to the mix. </P></div><img src = "pics/God of War Ragnarok/God of War Ragnarok02.jpg" padding:right = 2000px align = "right"  alt = "GOD OF WAR RAGNAROK" width="450" height="250"></a>
<P>The trailer also introduces some intriguing new characters like Angrboda, who  developer Sony Santa Monica has said is "one of the last remaining giants." That big guy at the end? That's Tyr, son of Odin, half-brother of Thor and Baldur, but imprisoned by his own father and so likely to want to settle the score with daddy.</P>
<p>At the end of 2018's God of War Kratos and Atreus discover that Faye, AKA Mrs Kratos, was actually a giant called Laufey, making Atreus half god and half-giant, and with another name: Loki. Yes, that Loki, the one from Norse mythology who is often portrayed as a trickster, sometimes with shapeshifting abilities. God of War played pretty fast and loose with Norse mythology but could offer some hints as to what's to come. </p>
<p>Once that big revelation is out of the way, we're told Fimbulwinter is coming. If you skipped your Norse mythology class - shame on you - then know that this is a three-year 'great winter' that proceeds Ragnarok, the Norse apocalypse.</p>
<p>Post credits, there's a second ending when you return home and, there, Thor appears 'several years later'. It's a brief tease, ending after Kratos asks him what he wants. It could be that Thor wants revenge for that whole Kratos 'killing his sons' thing, or, he might want his help stopping Ragnarok.</p>
